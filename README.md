# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Visualizer
Implemented some popular pathfinding algorithms and visualizer for a 2D grid. 
Players can draw walls on the grid, or alternatively generate mazes. After that, determine the start and end positions on the grid and choose from 5 different pathfinding algorithms!
Get the required dependencies from "requirements.txt" and run "maze.py" to see pathfinding in action!

# Key-bindings
"m": Toggle between mouse input mode

"CTRL+c": Clears the grid of all colors and walls

"CTRL+r": Resets the grid of all colors, but keep walls
